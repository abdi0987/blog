# Web components

Web components have been called the future of the web and yet only one browser fully supports them. First introduced in 2011 web components shook the web developer community everyone was sure this was were the web was headed. It’s been 4 years and it seems like web components should be a common practice but thats not the case. So what has happened to the future of the web?

>According to Dr. Axel Rauschmayer’s blog post. 
>Web Components are a suite of specifications that help with implementing custom HTML elements.

So instead of a bunch of divs

```html
<div class=’post-title’>
    <h1>
    </h1>
</div>
```

You have something like

```html
<post-title>
</post-title>
```

Much better right? It small concise and if a another developer looks at your html he/she can get an idea of what this page is.

## Hope

Web components problem is not developer adoption but browser support. As of the publishing of this post Google Chrome ,Opera , and Mozilla Firefox nightly support web component. But browser support for web components have rather been disappointing. Now this does not mean web components are dead and forgotten. Companies like Mozilla ,Google and other are working together to come to an agreement on web components. Employees from Mozilla, Microsoft, Google, Apple and others have meet two time this and discussed on specification on shadow dom and custom elements. So the proposed future of the web is not dead.
